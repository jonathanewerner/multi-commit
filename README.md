# multi-commit

this is a python tool that allows you to stage hunks in a new way:
you can assign them to multiple future commits on the fly. that way you can just browse through them once and be done, plus you have finegrained commits with minimal effort.

missing:
 - splitting hunks

bugs:
 - single '' in commit message break subprocess.call
 -
